# Fen Light FL

A Kodi video addon. Fork of [Fen Light](https://github.com/FenlightAnonyMouse/FenlightAnonyMouse.github.io) with [FlickList](https://flicklist.tv) integration instead of Trakt.

## What is this?

Fen Light FL replaces Trakt with FlickList for watch tracking. Same great addon, different backend. If you prefer FlickList over Trakt, this is for you.

## Credits

- **AnonyMouse** — Original Fen Light AM author. All the hard work is theirs.
- **Tiki Peter** — Created the original Fen / Fen Light that this lineage descends from.
